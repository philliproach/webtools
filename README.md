# WebTools

A curated collection of fast, browser-based utilities and micro-tools for developers, designers, and everyday users. WebTools gathers dozens of single-purpose web utilities into a clean, consistent interface so you can solve small problems quickly — without installing anything.

## What this project contains

- A wide range of client-side tools located under `src/tools/`, including (but not limited to):
  - Annotator, Base64 Encoder, BMI Calculator, Calculator, Clipboard Helper
  - Code Formatter, Color Palette, Color Picker, CSV → JSON
  - File Converter (many formats + landing redirects), Image Compress, Image Editor, Image→ASCII
  - JSON Formatter, JWT Decoder, Markdown Editor, Meme Generator, Password Generator
  - Pomodoro, Python Editor (Pyodide), QR Generator, Random Name/Number, Regex Tester
  - SHA256 Hasher, Hash Generator, Slugify, Text Case Converter, Text Diff, Timestamp/Timezone tools
  - Todo List, Unit Converter, URL Encoder/Parser, UUID Generator, Word Counter, YouTube Downloader
  - ...and several additional small utilities and landing pages.

Each tool is implemented as a single HTML page (plus optional JS/CSS) so individual tools are easy to open, test, and reuse.

## Why use WebTools over other sites

- Comprehensive single place — instead of opening multiple sites for small tasks, WebTools keeps many useful utilities consolidated and consistently styled.
- Instant and lightweight — tools are tiny, load quickly, and focus on accomplishing one task well without extra clutter.
- Offline-capable and self-hostable — because each tool is static HTML/JS/CSS, you can run the site locally or host it on any static hosting platform.
- Easy to extend — new tools follow the same layout and are simple to add as standalone pages under `src/tools/`.
- Clean UX — consistent header, navigation, and design reduce the friction of switching between tools.

These points make WebTools a great choice when you want an efficient, predictable toolkit that stays out of your way and helps you get small jobs done quickly.

## Contributing

- Fixing layout or accessibility issues
- Improving documentation or examples

Please open a pull request with a clear description of the change and a short demo of the new/changed tool.
