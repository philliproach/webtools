                    <h2>1. What this policy covers</h2>
                    <p>This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect when you use WebTools, why we collect
                        it, how we use it, and what choices you have. WebTools is primarily a set of browser-based
                        utilities and a secure file sharing feature. Most tools run entirely in your browser and do not
                        send your data to our servers. Where server-side handling is required (for example, temporary
                        file storage for sharing), those actions are described below.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="legal-section">
                    <h2>2. Information we collect</h2>
                    <p>We collect a small set of information necessary to operate the service:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Files you choose to upload:</strong> Files uploaded for sharing are stored
                            temporarily
                            on our servers only to enable sharing and are deleted as described in "Data retention".
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Technical & Usage Data:</strong> We log IP addresses, timestamps, file sizes, and
                            basic user agent strings when you interact with server-backed features. This helps us
                            operate, secure, and debug the service.</li>
                        <li><strong>Minimal Cookies / Local Storage:</strong> We may use cookies or local storage for
                            non-tracking functionality such as UI preferences or to keep you logged in if a service
                            requires it. We do not use advertising or third-party tracking cookies.</li>
                    </ul>

                <section class="legal-section">
                    <h2>3. How we use the information</h2>
                    <p>We use collected information only for the following purposes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To provide, secure, and maintain the features you use (for example, storing and
                            delivering files you upload for sharing)</li>
                        <li>To detect and prevent abuse, fraud, and security threats</li>
                        <li>To improve the service and fix bugs</li>
                        <li>To comply with legal obligations</li>

                    <p>We retain data only as long as necessary to provide the service or as required by law:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Uploaded files:</strong> By default, files uploaded for sharing are deleted after
                            24 hours or immediately after the first successful download, whichever comes first. If a
                            file fails to upload or transfer properly, we retain it only as long as necessary to
                            attempt recovery and then delete it.</li>
                        <li><strong>Logs & technical data:</strong> Access logs and related technical data are retained
                            for up to 30 days to support security incident investigations.</li>
                        <li><strong>Aggregated/anonymized data:</strong> We may keep aggregated usage statistics
                            indefinitely for analytics that do not identify individual users.</li>

                    <p>Many WebTools utilities run completely in your browser. For these tools we do not collect or
                        transmit your inputs to our servers. We may use local storage or cookies for user preferences

                    <p>We follow recognized security practices to protect data, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Transport encryption (HTTPS) for all server communication</li>

                        extremely sensitive data without additional protections under your control (for example, end-
                        to-end encryption you manage yourself).</p>
